  messageCredits: CREDITS_CONFIG.CREDITS_PER_MESSAGE
});

// Atomic credit deduction with dual-currency support
const deductResult = await deductCredits(userId, creditCost);

// Two-tier memory compression for long conversations
const summaryResult = await processConversationSummary(
  userId, botId, messages, getUserTier(userProfile)
);
```
